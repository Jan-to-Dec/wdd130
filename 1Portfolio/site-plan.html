      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to serve as the most basic indicator I can show in the Korean job market ahead of graduation. As a prospective data analyst/data scientist, I am documenting my journey so far and what skills I have. I know the importance of a technology blog, it showcases what I've learned and lets me know how much technology I can use.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> To be polite, I decided this:
        First, the hiring manager
        Second, potential team members
        Third, data analyst/data scientist (LinkedIn)
        Fourth, job seekers in similar fields
        The hiring manager will have learned the contents of the job posting in advance about the type of person they are hiring, and will want to include those parts. This website has two service pages. Write in anticipation of what they will read</p>  <!-- change this -->
